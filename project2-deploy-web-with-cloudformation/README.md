# Project 1: Deploy Static Website on AWS
In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS by performing the following steps:

1. You will create a public S3 bucket and upload the website files to your bucket.
2. You will configure the bucket for website hosting and secure it using IAM policies.
3. You will speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.
4. You will access your website in a browser using the unique CloudFront endpoint.

# Explanation of the files in the repository
1. ```./network.yml```: Yaml network config file
2. ```./network-parameters.json```: json file to store network parameters 
3. ```./servers.yml```: Yaml server config file
4. ```./server-parameters.json```: json file to store server parameters 
5. ```./create.bat``` or ```./create.sh```: .bat file is used for execution on windows while .sh for linux or macos, to create aws stack (cloud formation)
6. ```./update.bat``` or ```./update.sh```: .bat file is used for execution on windows while .sh for linux or macos, to update aws stack (cloud formation)
7. ```./delete.bat``` or ```./delete.sh``: .bat file is used for execution on windows while .sh for linux or macos, to delete aws stack (cloud formation)
